IANA-managed Reserved Domains

Certain domains are set aside, and nominally registered to “IANA”, for specific policy or technical purposes.

Example domains

As described in RFC 2606 and RFC 6761, a number of domains such as example.com and example.org are maintained for documentation purposes. These domains may be used as illustrative examples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are not available for registration or transfer.

Test IDN top-level domains

These domains were temporarily delegated by IANA for the IDN Evaluation being conducted by ICANN.

Policy-reserved domains

We act as both the registrant and registrar for a select number of domains which have been reserved under policy grounds. These exclusions are typically indicated in either technical standards (RFC documents), or contractual limitations.

Domains which are described as registered to IANA or ICANN on policy grounds are not available for registration or transfer, with the exception of country-name.info domains. These domains are available for release by the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee Secretariat.

Other Special-Use Domains

There is additionally a Special-Use Domain Names registry documenting special-use domains designated by technical standards. For further information, see Special-Use Domain Names (RFC 6761).
